### Setup

#### 1. Cloning the Repository

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```

#### 2. Creating a Virtual Environment

To isolate the dependencies for this project, create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On Linux/Mac**:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- **On Windows**:
  ```bash
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

#### 3. Installing Dependencies

Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### Usage

After setting up the environment and installing dependencies, you can run the main script as follows:

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will start, and its functionality will depend on how `main.py` is implemented.

---

### Notes

- Always activate the virtual environment before running the script or installing new dependencies.
- To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:
  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```
